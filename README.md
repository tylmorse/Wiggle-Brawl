**************WIGGLE BRAWL**********************

This is an in progress game made for WigglySenpai on Twitch.

If you are on Windows, you can run the game by running the executable file WiggleBrawl.

If you are on Linux, you should open a terminal in the game folder and run ./WiggleBrawl.

If you are on Mac, I am sorry. You can run the game the same way as Linux.


You can control the tiny lad using WASD + Space or by using the arrow keys.
